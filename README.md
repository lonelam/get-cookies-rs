`get-cookies-rs` is a Rust library designed to facilitate the retrieval of cookies from any website using the `Wry` library for easy cross-platform compatibility. This makes it ideal for developers needing a consistent tool across Windows, macOS, and Linux, without relying on specific browsers which may enlarge your program size.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Thanks to `Wry`, `get-cookies-rs` operates seamlessly on various operating systems, making it an excellent choice for cross-platform applications.
- **Asynchronous API**: The library supports asynchronous operations, utilizing Rust's modern async/await syntax for efficient, non-blocking I/O.
- **Flexible Cookie Retrieval**: Allows users to retrieve cookies based on customizable conditions, offering robust solutions for web scraping and automated testing.

## Installation

To use `get-cookies-rs` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
get-cookies = "0.2.0"
```

## Prerequisites

Linux need extra browser gtklib installed, see [wry documentation](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/tree/wry-v0.39.3) to install.
Windows and MacOS need no extra dependency.

## Usage

```rust
use get_cookies::read_cookie_until;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let cookie_str = read_cookie_until("https://github.com", |c| c.contains("logged_in=yes")).await?;
    println!("your github cookie: {cookie_str}");
    Ok(())
}
```
